# Simple-TODO-LIST-Project
 This project was made for me to remind myself how to make this stuff after couple months
 of break, in the future I would like to make more complex/fun projects!
 # Techonologies used
 - React.js
 - Next.js
 - Typescript
 - Tailwindcss 
# Gif Presentation

# There are some errors showing up in a console but everything works still fine as it should
Note. If you try to edit couple task descriptions at the same time it may break, I didn't want to
fix that because this project is just a reminder as I said before and I didn't want to waste more time
on this
